## CAD files
Everything needed to build the mechanical components for both drones will be found here. Nearly all files herein are using some version of Autodesk software. 

The parent [F450](/CAD_Files/F450) and [PRIAM](/CAD_Files/PRIAM/) folders contain Fusion360 models which in turn contain all of their components. In addition, the sub-folders contain Inventor and DWG models of the custom mechanical parts.
