# Flamewheel F450
This folder contains the 3D CAD models and some information of the F450 pre-cursor to the larger drone. The Fusion360 model contains all parts and sub-assemblies for the model which can also be exported in AutoCAD Inventor if needed. All 3D models are as close to the real thing as I could reasonably make them.

This is what the F450 looks like in a CAD model vs real life:

It is capable of cm-level accuracy using RTK positioning.
